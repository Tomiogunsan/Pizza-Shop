        <p>JZ-Pizza is all about quality you can trust. As one of the original founding pizza brands 
            and the 3rd largest pizza chain in Africa, our sole mission is making the freshest,
             tastiest and funnest pizza around our classic pan pizza will always be a fan favourite, 
             with a soft and chewy crust perfectly balancing out the healthy tomato pure and 
             mozzarella - cheddar blended cheese. Our authentic Italian crust for those who would
              prefer a light and airy crust to more fully enjoy the toppings. Thin, light and delicious.</p>
